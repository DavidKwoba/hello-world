Introduction to Github
My name is David Kwoba, and I'm new to Computer Science. Over the past year I've learned
C, Python, HTML and CSS, JavaScript and C++ with 2 languages being self-taught. I'm
interested in the use of Computer Science in the social sector and artificial
intelligence. I'm also hot as hell ðŸ˜‚.

Testing a pull request.
